================
Quentin Guibert, Gaëlle Pincemin & Frédéric Planchet

This github repository illustrated application presented in the paper **Impacts of Climate Change on Mortality: An extrapolation of temperature effects based on time series data in France**. In this paper, we present many applications of a multi-population mortality model ingretating temperature effects in France. This document includes example codes on `R` to reproduce the process presented in this article.
